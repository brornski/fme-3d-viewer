                    <p>Dental implants are the gold standard for replacing missing teeth. A titanium post is surgically placed into the jawbone, where it fuses permanently through osseointegration. Once healed, a custom porcelain crown is attached — creating a restoration that looks, feels, and functions exactly like a natural tooth. With a 95-98% success rate, implants can last a lifetime.</p>

                    <h4>Permanent & Long-Lasting</h4>
                    <p>Dental implants are designed to last 30+ years — potentially a lifetime with proper care. Unlike dentures or bridges that need replacement every 5-15 years, implants are a one-time investment.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Preserves Jawbone</h4>
                    <p>When teeth are lost, the jawbone deteriorates over time. Implants stimulate the bone just like natural tooth roots, preventing bone loss and preserving facial structure.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Natural Look & Feel</h4>
                    <p>Custom porcelain crowns are matched to your natural teeth in color, shape, and translucency. Implants feel and function exactly like real teeth — eat, speak, and smile with confidence.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>95-98% Success Rate</h4>
                    <p>Dental implants have one of the highest success rates of any surgical procedure. Modern implant technology and materials make the procedure highly predictable and reliable.</p>

                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Implants vs. Dentures</h4>
                    <p>Implants are fixed and permanent — no adhesives, no slipping, no removal for cleaning. Dentures are removable, can shift during eating and speaking, and accelerate bone loss over time.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Implants vs. Bridges</h4>
                    <p>Implants preserve adjacent healthy teeth. Bridges require grinding down neighboring teeth for support. Implants also last significantly longer (30+ years vs. 10-15 years for bridges).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Cost vs. Value</h4>
                    <p>While implants have a higher upfront cost ($3,000-$5,000 per tooth), their longevity makes them more cost-effective over time. Dentures and bridges require periodic replacement and maintenance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Quality of Life</h4>
                    <p>Implant patients report significantly higher satisfaction than denture wearers. Eat any food, speak clearly, and smile confidently without worrying about loose or shifting prosthetics.</p>
