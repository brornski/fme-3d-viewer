                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Dramatically Better Results</h4>
                    <p>Professional whitening uses higher concentration agents than over-the-counter products, delivering results up to 8 shades lighter. Drugstore strips typically achieve only 1-2 shades of improvement.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Safe & Supervised</h4>
                    <p>Treatment is supervised by a dentist who customizes the process for your teeth and sensitivity level. Gum protection is applied to prevent irritation — something not possible with generic strips.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Even, Consistent Coverage</h4>
                    <p>Custom trays and professional application ensure even whitening across all teeth — no streaks, missed spots, or uneven results common with over-the-counter products.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Fast Results</h4>
                    <p>In-office whitening delivers results in a single visit. Take-home strips require weeks of daily use for modest improvements. Professional whitening respects your time.</p>

                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Concentration</h4>
                    <p>Professional products contain 25-40% hydrogen peroxide or equivalent. Over-the-counter strips contain only 3-10%. Higher concentration means significantly better results in less time.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Custom Fit</h4>
                    <p>Professional trays are made from your dental impressions for a perfect seal. Generic strips and trays don't conform to your teeth, leading to uneven whitening and gel contact with gums.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Safety</h4>
                    <p>Professional whitening includes gum barriers, sensitivity management, and dental supervision. Over-the-counter products can cause gum burns and enamel damage if misused.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Longevity</h4>
                    <p>Professional whitening results last 6 months to 2 years with proper care. Over-the-counter results fade much faster and require more frequent reapplication.</p>

                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>How much does teeth whitening cost?</h4>
                    <p>In-office whitening costs $300-$800. Custom take-home trays cost $200-$400. Combination packages are available for the best value and results.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>How long do results last?</h4>
                    <p>Results last 6 months to 2 years depending on diet and habits. Avoiding coffee, wine, and tobacco extends results. Take-home trays allow easy touch-ups.</p>

                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>Is whitening safe for my teeth?</h4>
                    <p>Yes. Professional whitening is safe and FDA-approved when supervised by a dentist. It does not damage enamel. Some temporary sensitivity is normal and resolves quickly.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>Will my teeth be sensitive?</h4>
                    <p>Some patients experience temporary sensitivity during or after treatment. It resolves within 24-48 hours. We use desensitizing agents and adjust intensity for sensitive patients.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>Can whitening remove all stains?</h4>
                    <p>Whitening is highly effective for extrinsic stains (coffee, wine, tobacco). Intrinsic stains (medication-related, fluorosis) may respond partially. <a href="cosmetic.html" style="color:var(--team-blue);">Veneers</a> are an alternative for stubborn discoloration.</p>

                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>In-office or take-home — which is better?</h4>
                    <p>In-office delivers immediate results (1 visit). Take-home offers flexibility over 1-2 weeks. Combining both gives the best results with maintenance capability.</p>
