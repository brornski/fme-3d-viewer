            <div class="services-grid">
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Prevent Cavities</h4>
                    <p>Professional cleaning removes plaque and tartar that brushing alone cannot eliminate. Tartar buildup leads to tooth decay — regular cleanings are your best defense against cavities.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Prevent Gum Disease</h4>
                    <p>Gum disease (gingivitis and periodontitis) is the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. Regular cleanings remove bacteria below the gumline that cause inflammation and bone loss.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Early Detection</h4>
                    <p>Regular checkups catch problems early when they're simplest and least expensive to treat. A small cavity found today prevents a root canal or extraction tomorrow.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Overall Health Connection</h4>
                    <p>Oral health is linked to heart disease, diabetes, and other systemic conditions. Regular dental care supports your whole-body health and can detect early signs of systemic disease.</p>

                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>How much does a dental cleaning cost?</h4>
                    <p>Routine cleanings cost $75-$200 without insurance. Most dental plans cover two cleanings per year at 100%. We accept 40+ insurance plans and offer competitive self-pay rates.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>How often should I get a cleaning?</h4>
                    <p>Every 6 months for most patients. Those with gum disease or higher risk may need cleanings every 3-4 months. Your dentist will recommend the right frequency for you.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>Does dental cleaning hurt?</h4>
                    <p>Routine cleanings should not be painful. You may feel mild pressure or sensitivity with heavy tartar buildup. We offer topical numbing gel for patients with sensitivity.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>What is the difference between cleaning and deep cleaning?</h4>
                    <p>A routine cleaning is preventive, removing buildup above the gumline. A deep cleaning (scaling and root planing) treats gum disease by removing bacteria and tartar below the gumline.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>Does insurance cover cleanings?</h4>
                    <p>Most dental insurance covers two preventive cleanings per year at 100% with no copay. We accept 40+ plans including Aetna, Cigna, Delta Dental, MetLife, and United Healthcare.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>What should I do between cleanings?</h4>
                    <p>Brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, floss daily, use mouthwash, limit sugary foods, and avoid tobacco. Good home care between visits keeps your teeth and gums healthy.</p>
