                    <h4>Consultation & 3D Planning</h4>
                    <p>Advanced CBCT 3D imaging maps your jawbone anatomy to plan optimal implant positioning. We create a surgical guide for precise, predictable implant placement.</p>

                    <h4>Strategic Implant Placement</h4>

                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Fixed, Non-Removable Teeth</h4>
                    <p>Unlike dentures, All-on-X teeth are permanently fixed to implants. No adhesives, no slipping, no removing at night. They function exactly like natural teeth.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Fewer Implants, Full Results</h4>
                    <p>Traditional full-arch restoration might require 8-10 implants. All-on-X achieves the same result with just 4-6, reducing surgery time, cost, and healing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Works with Bone Loss</h4>
                    <p>Angled implants engage available bone in the anterior jaw, often eliminating the need for bone grafting. Patients with significant bone loss who were told they can't get implants may still qualify.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Immediate Function</h4>
                    <p>Many patients receive functional teeth the same day as surgery. Eat soft foods within days, resume a normal diet within weeks — no months of living without teeth.</p>

                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>All-on-X vs. Dentures</h4>
                    <p>Dentures are removable, can slip during eating and speaking, and accelerate bone loss. All-on-X teeth are fixed, stable, and preserve jawbone through implant stimulation.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>All-on-X vs. Individual Implants</h4>
                    <p>Replacing every tooth with individual implants (8-14 per arch) costs significantly more. All-on-X achieves a full-arch result with just 4-6 implants at a fraction of the cost.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>All-on-4 vs. All-on-6</h4>
                    <p>All-on-4 uses 4 implants per arch; All-on-6 uses 6 for extra stability. Your doctor recommends the optimal number based on bone density, arch shape, and bite force requirements.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Long-Term Value</h4>
                    <p>While All-on-X has a higher upfront cost than dentures, the implants can last a lifetime. Dentures need replacement every 5-8 years, making All-on-X more cost-effective over time.</p>

                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>How much does All-on-X cost?</h4>
                    <p>All-on-X typically costs $20,000-$40,000 per arch depending on materials and complexity. We accept 40+ insurance plans and offer flexible financing options.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>Can I get new teeth in one day?</h4>
                    <p>Yes. Many All-on-X cases allow same-day temporary teeth — you leave the office with a full set of functional teeth. Permanent prosthesis is placed after 3-6 months of healing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>All-on-4 vs. All-on-6?</h4>
                    <p>All-on-4 uses 4 implants, All-on-6 uses 6 for extra stability. Your doctor will recommend the best option based on your bone density and needs.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>What if I have bone loss?</h4>
                    <p>All-on-X is designed for bone loss cases. Angled implants engage available bone, often eliminating the need for bone grafting. Most patients qualify even with significant bone loss.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>How long do they last?</h4>
                    <p>The titanium implants can last a lifetime. The prosthetic teeth typically last 15-20 years before needing replacement. Regular maintenance visits ensure long-term success.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>Can I eat normally?</h4>
                    <p>Yes. After initial healing (soft foods for a few weeks), All-on-X patients eat a fully normal diet — steak, apples, corn on the cob. No food restrictions like with dentures.</p>
