            <div class="services-grid">
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Intraoral Appliance Placement</h4>
                    <p>First, an intraoral appliance — often a rapid palatal expander (RPE) with hooks — is bonded to the upper teeth. This serves as the anchor point for the face mask's elastic traction.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Face Mask Fitting</h4>
                    <p>The external face mask frame rests on padded contact points at the forehead and chin. Heavy elastics connect from the frame to hooks on the intraoral appliance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Forward Jaw Traction</h4>
                    <p>The elastics apply gentle, continuous forward force on the maxilla (upper jaw), encouraging it to grow forward and correct the underbite. Worn 12-16 hours daily, primarily evenings and overnight.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Monitoring & Phase 2</h4>
                    <p>Treatment lasts 6-14 months with regular check-ups every 4-8 weeks. After the jaw relationship is corrected, patients transition to Phase 2 orthodontics (braces or Invisalign) for final alignment.</p>

                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Non-Surgical Underbite Correction</h4>
                    <p>Face mask therapy corrects underbites without surgery in approximately 75% of cases when started during growth years. Early treatment can eliminate the need for orthognathic jaw surgery later.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Guides Natural Jaw Growth</h4>
                    <p>Rather than forcing bones into position, the face mask works with your child's natural growth patterns to guide the upper jaw forward — producing stable, lasting results.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Improved Facial Harmony</h4>
                    <p>Correcting a skeletal underbite during growth years improves facial balance and profile. The upper jaw moves into proper alignment with the lower jaw for a harmonious appearance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Cost-Effective Prevention</h4>
                    <p>Early face mask treatment can prevent the need for costly jaw surgery ($20,000-$80,000) later in life. Interceptive orthodontics is a fraction of the cost of surgical correction.</p>

                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Ages 6-10 (Ideal Window)</h4>
                    <p>The upper jaw is actively growing during this period. Starting treatment before age 10 maximizes the chance of full correction. The American Association of Orthodontists recommends evaluation by age 7.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Skeletal Underbite (Class III)</h4>
                    <p>Children diagnosed with skeletal Class III malocclusion — where the upper jaw is underdeveloped relative to the lower jaw — are primary candidates for face mask therapy.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Maxillary Deficiency</h4>
                    <p>Children with a flat or concave midface profile caused by an underdeveloped upper jaw benefit from forward protraction to encourage maxillary growth.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Anterior Crossbite</h4>
                    <p>When the lower front teeth bite in front of the upper front teeth due to a jaw discrepancy rather than just tooth position, face mask therapy addresses the skeletal cause.</p>

            <h2>Face Mask vs. <em>Jaw Surgery</em></h2>
            <div class="services-grid">
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Non-Surgical vs. Surgical</h4>
                    <p>Face mask therapy is completely non-surgical and works with natural growth. Orthognathic jaw surgery requires general anesthesia, bone cuts, wiring, and weeks of recovery.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Early vs. Late Treatment</h4>
                    <p>Face mask treatment during childhood prevents the problem from worsening. Jaw surgery is only performed after growth is complete (age 17-21), meaning years of living with the underbite.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Cost Comparison</h4>
                    <p>Face mask therapy costs a fraction of jaw surgery. Orthognathic surgery can cost $20,000-$80,000 including hospital fees, anesthesia, and braces, compared to face mask treatment at $3,000-$6,000.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-card">
                    <h4>Recovery Time</h4>
                    <p>No recovery downtime with face mask therapy — children continue school and activities normally. Jaw surgery requires 6-12 weeks of recovery with a liquid/soft diet and restricted activity.</p>
