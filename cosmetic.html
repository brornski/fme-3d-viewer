                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>How much do veneers cost?</h4>
                    <p>Porcelain veneers cost $900-$2,500 per tooth. Composite veneers cost $250-$1,500 per tooth. Cost depends on material and number of veneers. We offer financing options.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>How long do crowns last?</h4>
                    <p>Porcelain crowns typically last 10-15 years, with many lasting 25+ years with proper care. Avoiding hard foods and wearing a night guard (if you grind) extends longevity.</p>

                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>Crown vs. veneer — what's the difference?</h4>
                    <p>Crowns cover the entire tooth for strength. Veneers cover only the front surface for cosmetic improvement. Crowns are for damaged teeth; veneers are for appearance changes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="why-card">

                    <h4>How many visits does it take?</h4>

                <div class="why-card">
                    <h4>Are veneers permanent?</h4>
                    <p>Veneers require removing a thin layer of enamel, making them a permanent commitment. However, the veneers themselves last 10-20 years and can be replaced when needed.</p>
